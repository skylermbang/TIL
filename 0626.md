Codeit Node Js Lecture

1) Node JS?

you can run the js outside of the web broswer
you can make server web? 
you can use js to make backend + frontend 


Node Js is not framework, its just enviroment 


REPL mode:

Read, Eval, Print,Loop mode ; 


2). Module ,   Sych , Asynch


Module :

 from math-tools.js
 
 you have to export to use the module from outside
         function add(a,b){
            return a+b;
        }


        /*  exports.__name to be used in ourside of this module = name of the function/thing in this module */
        exports.potato =add

        
        
   from main.js  
   have to import from the math-tools.js
   
          let add =require('./math-tools.js')  
          console.log(add.potato(1,2))
          
   
 if you export one function 
   you export one by one
                          exports.potato = add
                          
 if you export the whole instance 
   you export as a chunk ,  make it as one insatance
 
                        modules.exports = calculator
                            
   
   
module -> you cna write or you can download from others 

core module and 3rd part module :

core module : already in the node.js
3rd party module : other pople made it
