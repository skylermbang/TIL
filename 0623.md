2.   Cookie , Session ,  Cache



Cookie:  Store in the  client 
         It is included in the header , so when you request (https) , cookie information go along. Dont store the credntial information cuz it has low security 
         
      

Session:   Stored in the server
          You can store the data more safe but it stress the server, if you store too much , stress server too much
