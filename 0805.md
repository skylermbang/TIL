- Authentication vs Authorization 

authentication :   confrimes that users are who they say they are; 

                               imagine you go to hotel and check in  and get the hotel room key card



authorization :       give those users permission to access a resoucres

                               imagine using the key card and go in to your own hotel room  or gym ... etc 





-Stateful vs stateless

stateful:  get the key from the recpetion , but the key is  connect to reception by rope 

                 so the reception can have control of the key   



              Pros        : easy to revoke / control of the key 

              Cons    : incraese server load , hard to scale , hard to intergrate with 3rd party 

               

                Session; 

                

stateless:  like the hotel room card, the reception wont give a shit.  

                  Pros :  low server load, easy to scale , easy to integrate with 3rd pary

                  Cons: cant revoke , less control , more complexity 





HTTP Authentication:

 

Bearer token authentication 

{"Authorization" : "Bearer TOKEN"}



JWT is not encrpyted , its just encoded. everyone can see. 



consisted with 3parts ,  header ,payload , footer 



Bcrypt :

  

initial data :  hello.     salt : hi 

hello hi =>  hash = >  392d3482js. (something high security) 



salt :  something randome data  with original data. to be hashed together to enhence the security

           

hash :







/auth/login



1. find email => if it exist => check password  => login (JWT token ) ,
