## Algorithm Lecture

____________
1.  Bubble Sort / Select Sort / Insert Sort



Bubble Sort and Select Sort always take O(N^2) , but Insert Sort in best case only O(N) cuz it can break the second loop

2. Divide and concqure / 분할정복  


Merge Sort : 

Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n*log n)

Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n*log n)

Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n*log n)

Suppose there is array [1,4,9,0,3,5,7,8]

by  the merge_sort : 
    

    Stage 1 
    [1],[4] => [1,4].      N/2 * 2
    [9],[0] => [0,9].      M/2 * 2   => N/4 * 4 = N
    [3],[5] => [3,5]
    [7],[8] => [7,8]
    Stage2
    [1,4],[0,9] => [0,1,4,9].    N/2 *2 = N 
    [3,5],[7,8] => [3,5,7,8]
    Stage3
    [0,1,4,8],[3,5,7,8] => [0,1,3,4,5,7,8,9,]

    
   .
   .
   .
   Stage K
    so every stage take N time complextiy 
    
   all the way to K stage :  N/2^K = 1   ->  long2N  
    So log2N * O(N) = O(NLogN)

  3. Stack 

     Last In First Out (LIFO).     like the laundry basket : last colthes in first out:
     
     ```
     push(data)
     pop()
     peek()
     isEmpty()
     ```
____________
  3. Queue 
 
     First In First Out (FIFO)  like the queue 
     
     ```
     enqueue(data)
     dequeue
     peek()
     isEmpty()
     ```
 ____________  
  4. Hash Table  ?   Store the "key" and "value". by hash function This is one of the fastest way to access the data  O(1) but it takes up more space

     
     
      '''
        index = hash(valu)% len(array)
      '''
     
     It has problem with collision.  (when the index is same )
     
     so the  Chainaing ( linked tuple) and Open addressing concepts are introduced.

  5.    Tree and Heap



   binary tree : 
   
   
   binary tree : only have two children
   
   Node :
   Rood Node : on the very top
   Level : on the top level 0  
   Parent Node :
   Child Node:
   Leaf Node :
   Sibiling
   Depth : the maximum level that tree can have  :  level -1 ?
   
   
   
          X        Level 0
        X X X      Level 1
      X   X  X     Level 2.  # not binazy tree since it has more then 2 children
      
      
      
          X        Level 0
        X   X       Level 1
         X X        Level 2.  # binary tree but not complete binary tree : complete binray tree have to fill from the left child 
   
   ---------------
   Tree implementaion:
   
   
         8   Level 0 :  [None, 8]
       6  3 Level 1 :  [None, 8, 6, 3]
      4 2 1 Level 2 :  [None, 8, 6, 3, 4, 2, 1]
   
   

   
   urrent index * 2 = left child
   
   current index * 2 +1 = right child
   
   current_index //2 = parent index 
   
   ----------------
   2^(h+1)-1  is the dept of the tree  when the high is h
   
   h= log(N+1)-1  when n Node
   
   highest height =  O(log(N)) since we ignore all the constant 
   
   
   Heap : Parent value is alway high  => root is the highest 
   
   thus the time complextity of the heap is also O(logN) since it is the hhighest height. 
   
   
   max_heap / min_heap => give you the max or min number. in O(logN)

   6. Graph
   
   '''
   Node = Vertex
   Edge = represent the realtionshp between node 
   Adjacent Node  = 
   
   '''
   
   There are Directed Graph and Undirected Graph 
   
   How to implement to code ?
   
   1) Adjacency matrix = by matx    
   2) Adjacnecy LIst = Linked list 
   ----------------
   7. DFS / BFS

  Depth First Traversal (Depth First Search)
  Visit the root
  For any node, traverse its subtrees before bisint the sibiling 
  
  Have to go all thew way down to depth :  less space needed , but hard to find the ideal path
  Can be implemented by stack 
  
  
  Breadth First Traversal (Breadth First Search)
  Visit the node in the tree in the order of their depth:
  Each depth the node are visited from left to right 
  
  Have to see all the data :  take more space 
  can be implemented by queue
  
  ------------------
  8. Dynamic Programming
  
  Fibonacci numbers ? 
   
   
  Overlapping subproblem can be solved by memoization
