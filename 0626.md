Codeit Node Js Lecture

1) Node JS?

you can run the js outside of the web broswer
you can make server web? 
you can use js to make backend + frontend 


Node Js is not framework, its just enviroment 


REPL mode:

Read, Eval, Print,Loop mode ; 

-------------------
2). Module 


Module :

 from math-tools.js
 
 you have to export to use the module from outside
         function add(a,b){
            return a+b;
        }


        /*  exports.__name to be used in ourside of this module = name of the function/thing in this module */
        exports.potato =add

        
        
   from main.js  
   have to import from the math-tools.js
    Node js use "require" to load other module
   
   
          let add =require('./math-tools.js')  
          console.log(add.potato(1,2))
          
   
 if you export one function 
   you export one by one
                          exports.potato = add
                          
 if you export the whole instance 
   you export as a chunk ,  make it as one insatance
 
                        modules.exports = calculator
                            
   
   
module -> you cna write or you can download from others 

core module and 3rd part module :

core module : already in the node.js
3rd party module : other pople made it not from node js
   
   
  Core Module :
  core module- filesystem
  
           const fs=require('fs')
           let fileList = fs.readdirSync('.')
           console.log(fileList)
  
           fs.writeFileSync('new', 'Hello_Node.js')  // writing if none, make one

  core module- os system
  
            const os =require('os')
            console.log(os.cpus())
            
   3rd Party module :        
   
   you can install by
        
         npm insatll module name
            
  you can  check the package-lock.jsaon file for which 3rd party directory in cwd
  node_module directory is the actual directory that 3rd party module installed.

3. Synch , Asynch
 
 
 Synch -  1. Send request
          2. Wait for response
          3. Next code
          
 
Asynch -  1. Send request
          2. go on with other code
          3. response when callback

 
 
 
 Synch Example -  readFileSync
 
         const fs = require('fs')
         console.log('Start')
         let content = fs.readFileSync('./new', 'utf8')  // encoding utf8
         console.log(content)
         console.log('finish')
         
  Result 
     
         Start
         data from new file
         Fnish
         
         
  This will just act as 'normal' programming -> from top to bottom 
  
     
 Asynch Example -  readFile
 
         const fs = require('fs')
         console.log('Start')
         fs.readFile('./new','utf8', (error, data)=> {
             console.log(data)
         })
         console.log('finish')


         
  Result 
     
         Start
         Fnish   
         data from new file

   This is asynch ,  the recommend from node js  ,  it will skipped the call back part and when it get respone it will bring the call back.
    *callback : function that will run  when certain taks is done, is called callback


 Important example
        
 This will wait 1second 
        
     setTimeout(callback, milliseconds)
           
           
 
You can also make async using event:

 event is very important because most of node.js are base(?) on the event, 
 many objects that emit events are instatnces of the event emitter class -
 
 
 Event 1 example
 
 
        const EventEmitter = require('events')  // core moudle name events   , EventEmitter class

        const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();  // instantiate 

 
        // on methode => callback ;
        // when event test , print success
        myEmitter.on('test', () => {
            console.log('Success! 1 ') 
        })
        myEmitter.on('test', () => {
            console.log('Success! 2') 
        })

        myEmitter.emit('test')
you can have multiple callback with one event
 
 make sure that one instance - set the callback, and then emmitt the event.
 
 
  Event 2 example
 when you trying to use the args from the event.

        const EventEmitter = require('events')  // core moudle name events   , EventEmitter class

        const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();  // instantiate 

        const object ={name: "skyler",  age : 20,  sex: 'male'}

        myEmitter.on('test', (info) => {
            console.log(info) 
        })


        myEmitter.emit('test' , object)

 4. API

Application programming Interface

Node js API != web browser API
